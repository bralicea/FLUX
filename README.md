# FLUX
FLUX is a video game written in Python's PyGame framework.
<p>
The game consists of a boss fight that is split into three stages, each presenting the player with a unique set of challenges.
The boss will use various different special abilities against the player during stages 1 and 3, and in stage 2 the player must survive a deadly asteroid field.
<p>
However, you will have some advantages! There are powerups that increase your damage output or regenerate your health, and a 'blink' ability can be used every fifteen seconds to quickly teleport in a certain direction.
Useful for dodging projectiles or asteroids!
